# Email SpellCheck Extension for Magento

Email SpellCheck extension for Magento helps your customers to spot and correct
any misspelled email addresses in your web forms - be it checkout, registration,
newsletter or any other form. Right after user finishes typing an email, extension
checks it for typos and suggests to correct it if finds any.

For example, if user enters "john@gnail.com" email address in any of your web forms
with the Email SpellCheck enabled, extension will check the email entered and show
"Did you mean john@gmail.com?" message next to the email field - user will be able
to fix the typo by simply clicking the suggestion.

Reduce any chances of users registering, signing up for newsletter or checking out
with incorrect email address! This extension can also be enabled for any web form
in Magento administrator panel - therefore, it helps you avoid misspelled email
addresses when entering information.
