Email SpellCheck extension for Magento helps your customers to spot and correct any misspelled email addresses in your web forms - be it checkout, registration, newsletter or any other form. Right after user finishes typing an email, extension checks it for typos and suggests to correct it if finds any.

If user enters "john@gnail.com" email address in any of your web forms with the Email SpellCheck enabled, extension will check the email entered and show "Did you mean john@gmail.com?" message next to the email field - user will be able to fix the typo by clicking the suggestion.

Reduce any chances of users registering, signing up for newsletter or checking out with incorrect email address. Extension can also be enabled for any web form in Magento administrator panel - therefore, it helps you avoid misspelled email addresses when entering customer, order or any other information.
